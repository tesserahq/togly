# Togly

## Testing

- Always run pytest with `ENV=test` set explicitly, e.g. `ENV=test poetry run pytest ...` — otherwise `Settings` silently falls back to the real `togly` dev database instead of `togly_test` (a `.env`-loading bug: `app/config.py`'s `Settings` config class is named `ConfigDict`, not `Config`/`model_config`, so pydantic-settings v2 never reads `.env`). A `relation "X" already exists` error during the alembic-migration test setup is the signature of this misconfiguration.
